When I initially got this book I thought I had wasted my money and put it on my bookshelf. Then after a few weeks I decided to give it a read. If you are starting out as an agile coach this book is a must read! I could related to nearly everything they had to say. The book is an easy read, it isn't to long but covers a lot of topics at a high level with practical advice. Thank you ladies!

What I got from it - never give up, pick your battles, think things through. How to handle a team that has members arriving late, planning, clean code at a high level, etc etc.
