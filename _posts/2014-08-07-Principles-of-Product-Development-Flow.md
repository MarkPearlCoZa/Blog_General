This book outlines at a principle level how one should tackle product development. I come from a Agile background and I found this book close a lot of loops for me. What I like about this book is that it elevates the discussion about product development to a higher level - the principle level. In addition, it gives concrete examples on why these principles work. 

I would recommend anyone involved in product development to read and re-read this book. So far I've read it once. It was a condensed read. I realize that for me to fully appreciate its message I'm going to have to read it in depth several times.

#### Notes ####
- Section on warefare and decentralized control
- Explanation on 'Bunching' and the two busses model
