#### We're moving ####

For those who haven't heard yet, this year my family and I will be going through some big changes. This week I received confirmation from New Zealand immigration services that my work visa has been approved. Early next month I will be joining MYOB in their Auckland offices to work with fellow South African Martin Cronje as well as a bunch of other great people.

Moving to the other side of the world with a young family is no small decision, it's been an emotional roller coaster ride. The hardest part of the move is the realization that we will be leaving family and friends we love behind - some of whom we may not see for a long time.  

While we are sad to go, we are also excited. Having spent a brief time visiting New Zealand, we are looking forward to raising a family there. New Zealand has it's own set of challenges and opportunities - but this post is not going to be about that. Today I would like write about some of the things I started that I have already or will soon be saying goodbye to. 

#### Maxima Software (2001 - 2016) ####

In 2001 I started a small software company creating manufacturing software for the kitchen industry - we called the company [Maxima Software](http://www.maximasoftware.co.za/). At the time I was young and naive with aspirations of making my millions. This month I stepped down as managing director of Maxima and sold my remaining shares in the company bringing to an end a 15 year involvement. 

Did Maxima achieve what I wanted it to achieve? Well, I never made my millions from it if that's what you are wondering - I did however have a bunch of experiences that have made me a better person. 

Without Maxima I wouldn't have had the opportunity to fund a 2 year sabatical to serve as a fulltime missionry for the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints](https://www.lds.org) - an experience that has had a major impact on my life, who I married, my children, education and what I value. If you are interested in finding out more about my experiences as a missionary, I would recommend you watch our [SACTM videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlplFqcQps0kZ9VmvGtDHRRkPXObGbQyq) - it gives you a glimpse into what the day and a life of a LDS missionary is like.  

One of the valuable experiences I had at Maxima was learning the end to end lifecycle of a software product. From conception to development to marketing to supporting - because of the size of the company I had to be involved in every aspect. Maxima has taught me some of the principles of the business of software that I hope to leverage going forward.

Another great experience I had with Maxima was the opportunity to serve for two years on the gauteng board for the [Kitchen Specialist Association](http://www.ksa.co.za/). While on the board I got to see how some of South Africa's kitchen industry leaders think - working with directors and representatives of Easy Life Kitchens, Sonae, PG Bison, Show Cupboards, etc. Many of the lessons I learn't from being on the board of the gauteng KSA bled through into how we structured the [DeveloperUG](www.developerug.org.za).

At Maxima I also had the opportunity to work with some great people. The first fulltime software developer that Maxima hired (barring myself) was Brendon Page - I had the pleasure of working with Brendon for ten years before he eventually left Maxima. I still enjoy touching base with him. My biggest take home from Brendon was his passion for creating software and his love of sharing that knowledge with others. He is a true talent.

A couple of years into working with Brendon, his brother, Jayd, joined Maxima as a software developer. Jayd is the polar opposite to Brendon in so many ways, but is also just as talented a software developer. My biggest take home from Jayd is his sincerity in seeing people as people first. 

I also had the brief pleasure of working with my brother Jonathan (when I left Maxima fulltime as a developer, Jonathan had just joined) while I wished we had more time to work together, I'm excited that Jonathan is going to carry on with Maxima when I am gone and has also taken up involvement in the DeveloperUG as one of the curent organizers.

#### DeveloperUG (2012 - 2016) ####

In late 2011 after having moved up to Johannesburg from Durban I had a desire to be involved in the 'software' community. I had attended a few TechEd conferences and was under the impression that Johannesburg had a software community. My first experience with the software community was at ERDUG (a small community organized by Andrew Jackson). ERDUG met occaisonally on Saturdays - and while I loved being involved it was a challenge to give my Saturday's away (especially with a young family) and to travel the distrance to the other side of Johannesburg.

The [DeveloperUG](http://www.DeveloperUG.org.za) originiated as an attempt to form a group closer to where I lived and on a week night (which gave me my Saturday's back). The group was orginially called the 'Programming Languages User Group' however we soon discovered that 'learning' a language as a user group was not something that promoted a group to grow or embrace new comers. We renamed the group - made it focus on more general topics - and hosted it on meetup.

The success of the DeveloperUG has been surprising. From a small group (5-7 people) that met once a month, the user group has grown and grown. We still meet once a month, with the original group meeting in Bryanstan at Microsoft's campuses and a off shoot group which started about 8 months ago meeting in Pretoria. Total membership of the DeveloperUG currently stands at 1750+ members with an average attendance at the monthly meetings ranging between 50 to 100 people (depending on what month of the year and who is speaking).

One of the great experiences I had with the group was being involved with the other organizers. Not only have I had the priveldge of working with other talented and passionate people (Terence, Robert, Candice, Bryan and Botha & Sean) in organizing the groups events, I have also had the priveledge of forming some great friendships. 

With Robert & myself moving in a short space of time there is some concern about the future of the group. I'm excited to welcome Jonathan Pearl and Bradley Van Aardt as supporting organizers to Candice and Terence for the Johannesburg group. Where the group goes forward is up to them. My advice to them is to keep it going until it stops becoming fun - at that point find others who share the values and passion for the group to carry it on, or if unable to, put it to bed.

In my mind, the foundational principles of the DeveloperUG is to do what's in the best interests of the local software community. Provide a safe place for people in our industry to meet, learn new things and interact without being suspcious of whether there are alterior motives. Another responsibility I have always felt the group had was to grow new 'speakers'. I have learn't a ton from speaking at conferences - and before one speaks at conferences it's important that there is a place where they can get speaking experience - I see this as one of the roles of the DeveloperUG.
