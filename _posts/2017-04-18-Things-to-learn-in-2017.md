Each year there is this proliferation of things to learn. 

In an effort to focus my learning around certain topics here's my list of tools / technologies I would like to have some experience in by the end of the year:

* Docker  
* Basic Ruby  
* Basic Python
* Elixir
* React
* Tmux  
* Quick check  

And go...
