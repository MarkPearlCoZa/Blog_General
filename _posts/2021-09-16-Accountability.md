# Why Accountability Slips

It can feel like an inquisition and causes discomfort often for both parties

# Teams needs both accoutnability and feedback

# Accountability Loop

* What will you do? (the commitment)
* When will you do it? (the timeframe)
* How will I know? (the reporting method)

# When someone doesn't follow through

* What stopped you from following through?
* Was this the right action? Is this still important?
* Whatâ€™s the real challenge here for you?
* How will you ensure you follow through next time?
