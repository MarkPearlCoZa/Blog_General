## Framing the interview

Hi X, I want to have a check in conversation with you to hear how you are feeling about Serko and your role. In preparation for the session think about what motivates you, What's working, what are the 1-3 things we could do to help support your personal/career motivations in the next 12 months. How we can better support you.


## Tips to run an effective stay interview 

* Get personal - Understand their aspirations, what inspires them, what they look for in work, what opportunities they want outside of work
* Understand why - understand why someone would want to move on.
