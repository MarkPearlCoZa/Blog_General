Why do we need to agree on underlying values and principles. The skeptic may argue agreeing on values and principles is window dressing or being overly idealistic. I see it differently...

Values and principles give us a foundation to base decisions on and to allow other people to project what our decision process would be in our absence.

For example, say as a a leader I have an underlying value of work/life balance and this translates to the principle that I do not work long hours (10+ hours) consecutively because it makes my work/life balance get out of join. Having identified that as a value and a prinicple allows someone else to determine what I would do in a given situaiton...

ie. a manager needs to determine if a team should work long hours for a month to hit a launch date - with an understanding of my values & principles they could project that I would not commit or be comfortable with that as a decision.

VUKA is a term I recently came across which was [first used in the milatary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility,_uncertainty,_complexity_and_ambiguity) to descrive situations where there was volatility, uncertainty, complexity or ambiguity... or put another way... the heat of battle. In those situations having shared values & principles allows people to operate and react faster.
