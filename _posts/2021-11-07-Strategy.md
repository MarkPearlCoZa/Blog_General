I hear a lot about strategy but have struggled in the past to understand how different strategies fit in together. Here are two things to help you get your head around product and technology strategy...

What questions should the product strategy answer?

*What should we build and why!*

What questions does the technical strategy answer?

*What technology should we invest in to build it, and what else is possible!*

What else is possible is a proactive investment to enable future capabilities

Good technology strategist constantly try to determine how to execute the product strategy faster or create new products we couldn't before.

Technology strategy always follows product strategy. It doesn't help deciding on what technology we should invest in without first understanding the business problem we are trying to solve.
