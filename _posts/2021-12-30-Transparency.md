It is important in the enviroments that I work that we foster a culture of transparency which means we should be as transparent as possible with our reasons for the decisions we make. 

This means sharing the rationale behind decisions. 

It also means sharing successes and failures.  

It is fine to disagree with a specific decisions. 

We do not want people to question the integrity or motivation behind a decision.
