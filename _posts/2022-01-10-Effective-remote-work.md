1) Have bookends to signify the beginning and end of day to help you transition into/out of the work mindset
i.e. running in the morning, going for a brief walk at the end of the day

2) Communicate as if everyone was remote 
* If in meetings, have everyone dial in separately
* Move communication one level up, if you were going to DM someone, rather communicate in the team channel so others can participate
* Use tools that are consumable remotely, i.e. Conflunece or Miro

3) Use appropriate mediums for communication
* Informal chat with responses same day > Slack
* Formal written conversation that requires some formatting/structure and response within 48 hours > Email 
* Immediate response / near immediate response > Video Meeting

4) For mission critical immediate responses use text message / phone call.

For the above, for all of these mediums comment/feedback is appreciated, so where you see a "no reply expected" do not feel that means you cannot give feedback, it just means it is not expected

5) Documentation
* Create an index that allows people to self-discover information

6) Healthy async communication practices
* As you go through your day keep your team informed about what you are working on 
* At the end of each week write a brief update about what you've been working on and why, and what is top of your mind going into the next week
* When having meetings, maintian an agenda with notes that contains the history of what has been talked about. Record each meeting and store it in a shared filesystem
* Have a regular cadence where people "clean up" your written documentation, that means adding things that are missing and archiving things that are no longer relevant

7) Scratch patch is a place to put short lived documents, long lived documents need to be moved out of the scratch patch and into a proper index

8) Have spaces between meetings, I need time between meetings to get my head in the right space, organise 20 or 50 minute meetings and always start meetings on the hour or half hour.

9) Consider a regular newsletter to send out around each value stream

10) Async videos tips
* Keep to under 5 minutes
* Link to any artifacts, ie. slide show
