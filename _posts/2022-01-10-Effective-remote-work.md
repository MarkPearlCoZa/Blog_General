1) Have bookends to signify the beginning and end of day to help you transition into/out of the work mindset
i.e. running in the morning, going for a brief walk at the end of the day

2) Communicate as if everyone was remote 
* If in meetings, have everyone dial in separately
* Move communication one level up, if you were going to DM someone, rather communicate in the team channel so others can participate
* Use tools that are consumable remotely, i.e. Conflunece or Miro

3) Use appropriate mediums for communication
* Informal chat with responses same day > Slack
* Formal written conversation that requires some formatting/structure and response within 48 hours > Email 
* Immediate response / near immediate response > Video Meeting

4) For mission critical immediate responses use text message / phone call.
