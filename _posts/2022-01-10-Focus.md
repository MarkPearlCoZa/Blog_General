We are surrounded by choices. Often we think the mantle of leaderships is to say no to bad opportunities and yes to good ones. If that were the case it would be easy to be a leader... the decisions would be obvious to everyone.

The challenge with leadership isn't to say no to bad opportunities and yes to good ones, it's being able to differentiate between good, better and best opportuniteis and saying yes to only the best ones.

Put another way... focus is not saying no to bad opportunities, itâ€™s saying no to other good opportunities.
