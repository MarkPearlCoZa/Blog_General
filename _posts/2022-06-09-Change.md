*Do people fear change?*

I've been reflecting a lot on myself and how I struggle with change. It's funny because change is an opportunity to improve things yet, I struggle with it. I came across this in an email recently and it really helped me make a mental shift.

| Change. Everything changes. All the time. Changes brought us more remote work than ever. Recently people have been called back to the office. Or work hybrid. Our workplaces are changing. And so are our ways of working.
| 
| When it comes to change, you have a responsibility as a leader. You are accompanying colleagues and team members through change, and you are encouraging. Supporting.
| 
| Peter Senge once said, "People don't resist change; they resist being changed."  So what is it people fear?
