Recently, I've been focusing on what my core values are. Why? Because I've found that whenever I break one of my core values, I experience cognitive dissonance. When I'm experiencing cognitive dissonance, it impacts my general happiness as a human.

How do you establish what your core values are? I hear you asking. One way is to go through a sheet of values words and identify which words resonate with you. Then, go through the specified values and rank them in order of importance. An example of a value list is Brene Brown's [list of values](https://brenebrown.com/resources/dare-to-lead-list-of-values/).

Luckily, I have done these assessments every few years, allowing me to review what I've identified as recurring values over time. These are the values that came up:

**Fairness** refers to me treating individuals impartially and without bias, regardless of their background or circumstances. It involves ensuring equal opportunities and outcomes and providing a level playing field for all.

**Integrity** refers to my internal compass around principles and adhering to them consistently. I aspire to be honest, trustworthy, and transparent in all of my actions and interactions.

**Growth** refers to my desire to grow and develop those around me. To help them develop and challenge themselves, pushing them out of their comfort zone.

**Sincerity** refers to my value of being genuine, honest, and transparent in my thoughts, feelings, and actions. It involves being truthful and authentic in my interactions with others and having a consistent and congruent internal state.

**Continuous improvement** refers to my value of improving the systems and processes around me. It involves not settling for the status quo.

**Openness** refers to my value of being receptive, inclusive, and non-judgmental towards different ideas, perspectives, and people. It involves being willing to listen and learn from others and being open to new experiences and possibilities.

**Mastery** refers to my value of pursuing excellence and continually improving my skills and abilities. I set high standards and goals and am committed to ongoing learning and development.

**Purposefulness** refers to having a clear sense of direction, meaning, and intention. 

**Empowered** refers to my value of giving myself and others the tools, resources, and support needed to achieve our goals and responsibilities. It involves promoting autonomy, agency, and self-determination and creating an environment of trust and collaboration.

**Trust** refers to my value of having confidence and reliance on the integrity, competence, and intentions of oneself and others unless evidence proves otherwise.

**Effective collaboration** refers to working with others in a constructive, efficient, effective, and mutually beneficial way. It involves communicating openly and respectfully, leveraging each other's strengths and resources, and sharing a common goal or purpose. 

Which gives me the acronym FIGS COMPETE.
