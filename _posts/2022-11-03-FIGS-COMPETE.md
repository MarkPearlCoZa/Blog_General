Recently, I've been focusing on what my core values are. Why? Because I've found that whenever I break one of my core values, I experience cognitive dissonance. When I'm experiencing cognitive dissonance, it impacts my general happiness as a human.

How do you establish what your core values are? I hear you asking. One way is to go through a sheet of values words and identify which words resonate with you. Then, go through the specified values and rank them in order of importance. An example of a value list is Brene Brown's [list of values](https://brenebrown.com/resources/dare-to-lead-list-of-values/).

Luckily, I have done these assessments every few years, allowing me to review what I've identified as recurring values over time. These are the values that came up:

Fairness  
Integrity  
Growth  
Sincerity  
Continuously improving  
Openness  
Mastery  
Purposefulness  
Empowered  
Trust  
Effective collaboration  

Which gives me the acronym FIGS COMPETE.
