I've spent some time reflecting on my thoughts about "winning" as a leader. While I could argue that some things don't have a finish line, you have never totally "won" or "lost". There are milestones, events or missions that you either achieve or don't with the subsequent rewards or consequences.

What I've learned about myself is achieving the mission is important to me. I like to win. Equally important to me is how we accomplished the mission. 

I am stealing a quote from the authors of "The Art of Scalability" that resonates with me.   

> The way in which a mission is accomplished is every bit as important as the actual accomplishment of the mission.

If you want to know more about what is important to me in the "how", see my [personal core values](http://blog.markpearl.co.za/FIGS-COMPETE).
