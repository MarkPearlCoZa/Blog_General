## Tips on negotiating with a vendor

1. If the cost is above $10K/year: it is negotiable.

2. Your main leverage is to promise that you will close the deal if the price is met: this means the salesperson can count on getting their commission.

3. Know the alternatives you are considering: and tell the salesperson which ones these are.

4. Keep pushing for the best price.

5. Be an open-minded expert picking the best overall solution.

6. Consider showing the salesperson a screenshot of a competitor product that has your company’s data, showing that you are in the process of onboarding.

7. If your procurement process is quick in turning around: you can save a lot of money.

8. Discounting levels vary, by a lot! But if you don’t ask, you won’t get the discounts you could otherwise obtain.”
