Once many many years ago, I had a huge argument with some people I really cared about. An outcome of that arugmeent was that I felt so hurt that I promised myself I would never let anyone hurt me like that again.

So I decided the best way not to get hurt was to not feel anything at all. I spent the next few years building up a protective field around myself and became fine.

When I was meeting friends, I was fine. If I had a tough meeting at work it would be fine. Even on my birthday, I was... fine. I didn't let anything get to me, and I felt unpenetrable. 
But being fine all the time has its downside. Where were the highs of life? As the years passed on of me being fine I realized that living like this was pointless. I wanted to feel alive and motivated and make a difference in the world. So, I started working on not being fine anymore. I started paying attention to my emotions and how I truly felt about things. Was I feeling happy, sad, let down, outraged, inspired or thrilled. It's taken a few years but this change has been life-changing for me. 

Most days I wake up feeling alive and ready to take on the day. Some days I wake up feeling down or hurt and in need of some self care. And that's ok.

If there is one thing I have learned in life it is to experience the good, you must know the bad. To feel the hot you must know the cold. And that's the true meaning of living life to the fullest - to feel.
