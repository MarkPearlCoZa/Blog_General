> "The right people are usually rewarded and recognized here."

As a leader, I've been thinking about how to reward and recognize the right people. I score a 5/10 on this right now. There are some things I am doing well and some areas I can improve.

When I think of reward and recognition. A few things come to mind:
* First, identify the right people, and then reward them properly. Balancing recognition for the team and individuals can be challenging.
* Consider the culture we want to create - individual vs. team

Here's how I rate myself:

# Regularly do   

* Say thank you directly  
* Have team lunches  
* Announce new or departing employees  

# Occasionally do  

* Give thank you shoutouts on Slack  
* Send employee care packs  
* Celebrate major milestones  

# Put some effort in doing more  

* Applaud work anniversaries  
* Recognize individual contributions with gift cards or similar  
* Begin meetings with a round of thank yous, like executives do monthly  
* Acknowledge tenure  

Where I want to focus:

* Introduce thank you's to team lunches  
* Post more thank you shout outs on Slack
* Recognize individual contributions with gift cards (need to think more about if this is good or bad)
* Acknowledge work anniversaries and birthdays
