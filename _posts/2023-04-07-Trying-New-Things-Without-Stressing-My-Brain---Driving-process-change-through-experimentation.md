title: Trying New Things Without Stressing My Brain - Driving process change through experimentation

I'm a person who enjoys routine, so when someone suddenly changes my routine, it can be tough for my brain to handle. However, when I come up with my own changes, I usually love them and can't see why others wouldn't agree. I've found that many people are like this. That's why I default to using experiments to help introduce changes wherever possible.

Here's how I do it: When I want to change something, I create an experiment plan that answers these questions:

Experiment name
Description (what's happening now and what will change, important to be detailed in the exact changes so it is actionable and cler)
Why we're trying it (problems with the current situation)
How long we'll try the experiment (start and end dates)
What we hope to see
What to watch out for
How we'll know if it's successful (I push hard to get metrics that are measurable, being clear on who will measure it - this is really important!)

Once I've written the experiment out, I move the experiment plan to a place I call "Draft Experiments" where everyone can see it. This gives me an opportunity to ask my team for their thoughts. I encourage people to share concerns or feedback on where it's not clear. This often drives some refinement of the written experiment to clear up ambiguity.

After feedback and adjustments I make a call - is there enough signal to indicate we should try it, or was this experiment idea a bad idea? 

When we start the experiment, sometimes things don't go well from the start. That's a good thing, it's quick feedback. Sometimes we all think something makes sense until we try and execute it at which point we get meaningful data.

If the experiment isn't going well, we reassess. Do we stop it or keep going. If we stop, I write a summary of what happened and move the experiment to an archive section. 

If the experiment runs through the full experimentation time at the end we assess the results and decide whether to adopt the new process, try another experiment, or go back to the old way.  Regardless of the action, it's documeted.

This approach helps because:

It keeps a record of what we're doing and why
It reminds me and others that it's okay to try and adjust if needed
It makes me think about how we'll know if the change is helpful
It helps me consider the impact on the whole system
It forces me to go through the rigor of measuring

So, using experiments makes it easier for my brain and my team to handle changes without getting stressed. Try it.
