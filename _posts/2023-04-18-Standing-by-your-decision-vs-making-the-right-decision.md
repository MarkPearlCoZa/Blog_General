As a manager, one of the most critical traits is the ability to make strong decisions. It's an essential skill that involves analysing information effectively, assessing risks and benefits, and making a decision promptly. The alternative to strong decision-making is indecision, which can create doubt and uncertainty, leading to a lack of focus and resentment. Things you want to avoid.

But what happens when you make the wrong decision? Is it better to stick to it or unwind it? This is a question that I've grappled with for a long time. If you keep changing decisions, it creates an environment of doubt and uncertainty that is dangerous. People begin to second-guess you, flip-flopping is exhausting for everyone involved and your standing as a leader can erode. Also, you create a culture where people re-litigate everything. In many instances, the side effects of changing a decision are worse than staying with the wrong decision. Sticking to it is better, even if you know it is wrong.

Does that mean that once a decision is made, you should never go back on it? Not always. You want to be on the right path for the very material decisions, even if it means backtracking a few times. For these material decisions, if it becomes clear that the decision is causing more harm than good, it's essential to unwind it. This is simple to say but hard to gauge. Often we don't know the damage caused by a material decision until it has been realised, and sometimes harm can move really fast.

How do you undo a wrong decision? It depends.

I prefer to be transparent and call it out, admitting that I got it wrong and that we're changing course. This works in many places but not all.

In many organisations being wrong can be career-limiting. I've seen various techniques employed by different leaders in these places. Some take the approach of evolving the decision gradually, while others prefer to make a clean break and start again without recognising it's a complete 180' turn. Ultimately, the best approach depends on the situation, the organisational context and the leader.
