## The importance of maintaining confidentiality in safe space.

 I want to emphasise the importance of maintaining confidentiality of safe spaces. Any information shared here should be treated with utmost care and respect.

While openness is a core value for me, I recognise that being open on everything all the time is not appropriate.

I don't share confidential information without first checking with the person sharing it, as this undermines the safety in the relationship. 

Breaking confidentiality undermines this as a "safe space" and erodes trust. 
Trust is critical in so many ways for us to be successful.
