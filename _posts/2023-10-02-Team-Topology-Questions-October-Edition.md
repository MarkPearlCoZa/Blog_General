I'm a fan of the book [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/) because it gives us a common language to describe the types of engineering teams in tech companies when an organisation gets more than just a handful of engineers. I've been working on a series of questions to deepen my and my team's understanding of the concepts. Here is the first round of them:

> Q1. Can you explain the main differences between Stream-aligned, Enabling, Complicated-subsystem, and Platform teams?

- Stream-aligned team
Primary focus: Deliver end-to-end value to a specific business area

- Enabling team
Primary focus: Supporting other teams in improving their ways of working in a specific area (patterns, approach)

- Complicated-subsystem
Primary focus: Managing a complex subsystem or critical capability within an organisation

- Platform team
Primary focus: Creating and maintaining common shared components and services used by multiple teams.

> Q2. How does the "Stream-aligned team" topology facilitate continuous delivery? 

It allows for the flow of development. Everyone needed to deliver a piece of value is in the stream, aligned, and with the same priority without dependencies on external teams that may have different priorities.

> Q3. Can you discuss the role of the "Enabling team" and provide some examples of their typical responsibilities?

Enabling team

Provide deep web-client expertise to help a stream-aligned team know the patterns and approach to writing a web-client
Provide deep automation expertise to help a stream-aligned team set up their deployment pipelines

> Q4. What are the benefits and drawbacks of using a "Complicated-subsystem team" in a larger organisation?

Benefits:
* It can be treated as its own entity
* Allows for a group of specialists who may not fit the normal team mould to be co-located

Drawbacks
* Create a bottleneck as you have a group of specialists or key domain knowledge
* Often have key people dependencies
* Scarcity

> Q5. How does a "Platform team" contribute to improved productivity in software development?

Ideally, the provide a self-service function that provides reusable components that other teams leverage. This increases developer productivity.

> Q6. Can you explain how team interactions like collaboration, X-as-a-Service, and facilitation work in practice?

> Q7. How does an emerging technology or tool influence the type of team topology that may be best suited to incorporate it?

> Q8. How can team topologies be modified or restructured as a company or product evolves?

> Q9. How does the concept of team topologies contribute to aligning the team structure with the organisation's business goals?

> Q10. How can team topologies help address common challenges in software delivery?

> Q11. Can the team topologies model be applied outside a DevOps or IT context?

> Q12. Can you share an example of how your organisation has benefited from the application of team topologies?

> Q13. How do different team topologies handle shared services or dependencies?

> Q14. How do the principles of Conway's Law interact with team topologies?

> Q15. Lastly, how do you ensure a balance between specialisation and siloing in different team topologies?
