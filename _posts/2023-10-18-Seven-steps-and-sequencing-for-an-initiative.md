The following method has proven to be effective when undertaking a change initiative. It includes these steps in sequence:

1. **Goal Definition**: Clearly describe what we aim to achieve. Define the desired future state.  

2. **Team and Role Descriptions**: Specify who is in the team and their respective roles. Among these roles, identify who will be the spokesperson and the executive sponsor.  

3. **Scope Determination**: Define what is within the project's focus (In Scope) and what is not (Out of Scope).  

4. **Success Metrics**: Establish the criteria or indicators that will be used to measure the project's success.  

5. **High Level GAP Analysis**: Evaluate the current state, identifying what needs changing or improving to reach the future state we want.  

6. **Activities we need to do**: What are the activities we need to do.  

6. **Project Timelines**: Estimate how long each part of the project will take, and establish a timeline for when specific deliverables should be completed.  

7. **Task Assignment**: Outline who is responsible for each task and aspect of the project.
