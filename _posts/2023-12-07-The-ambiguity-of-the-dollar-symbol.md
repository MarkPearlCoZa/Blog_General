title: The ambiguity of the dollar symbol

Having gone through a recent budgeting process, I want to bring to your attention the ambiguity associated with using the $ symbol. The $ symbol does not tell you the exact currency type, which can lead to some costly mistakes.

For instance, $1 could refer to USD 1, NZD 1 or AUD 1, depending on who's quoting it. If you have confused a million New Zealand dollars with a million US dollars, that's a mistake of roughly NZD 700,000.

To avoid confusion and ensure clarity, adopt the practice of including the three-letter abbreviation of the currency, such as NZD or, AUD or USD, when recording costs. This way, we can avoid any confusion or misinterpretation associated with using the $ symbol.
