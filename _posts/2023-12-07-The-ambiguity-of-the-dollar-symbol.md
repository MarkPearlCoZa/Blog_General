title: The ambiguity of the dollar symbol

Having gone through a recent budgeting process, I am struck by the ambiguity of the $ symbol. The $ symbol is contextual shorthand for many currencies but does not tell you the exact currency type, which can lead to some very costly mistakes.

For instance, $1 could refer to USD 1, NZD 1 or AUD 1, depending on who's quoting it. If you have confused a million New Zealand dollars with a million US dollars, that's a costly mistake (roughly NZD 700,000 or a small house).

The lesson I've learned. To avoid confusion and ensure clarity, always include the three-letter abbreviation of the currency, such as NZD or, AUD or USD, when recording costs. That means $10 is either NZD10 or AUD10 or USD10. This way, any confusion or misinterpretation associated with using the $ symbol is totally avoided.
