There are three tools that Culture Amp focuses on 
1) Scaling questions / gap analysis
2) Three-lens analysis
3) UC checking or pre-mortems

## Scaling questions / gap analysis

As a question like follows:

> On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you going to XYZ, 
> On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate how good we are at:

The ask a follow on question.

> What could we do to move the score one point?


## Three-lens analysis

> What could you do to ...

> What could your manager do to...

> What could your team do to...


# pre-mortems

> What could cause you to fail on this XYZ we are going to take on

> What could you do to mitigate this?
