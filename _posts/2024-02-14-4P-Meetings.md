#### 4 P Meetings - how do we make meetings more impactful?

Focus on the 4Ps of a meeting. Touch on each of the P's at the beginning of a meeting.

Purpose - why is this meeting happening? The purpose of this meeting is to [update, explore, decide...]

Product - what will the group have at the end of the meeting that didn't exist at the start? We will leave here with [five ideas, a decision, a list, greater connection,...]

Personal Benefit - how will this benefit each person attending? This will help you/us [save time, feel aligned, make an impact...]

Process -  how will we structure the conversation? We'll spend the first half on agenda point X and the second half on point Y. Make the process (the agenda) visible to everyone. Agendas should have time estimates for each item.
