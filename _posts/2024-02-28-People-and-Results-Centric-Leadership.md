There are many different ways to lead - one of the big risks of leading large groups is you begin to abstract away the humans in the process and see people as cogs. The problem with this it is easy for a company’s leadership to fall into the trap of viewing its workforce as a disposable resource “that you can turn off or turn on, or give away or sell, as opposed to an asset that you develop – with each person in that system being a human being with issues of dignity and wellbeing.

The other risk is that you only focus on the care of people without taking into consideration the need for performance. The problem with this is it is easy for people centered leaders to fall into the trap of not having hard conversations or always making allowances for poor performance.
