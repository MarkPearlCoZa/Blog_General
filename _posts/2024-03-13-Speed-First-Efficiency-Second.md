title: Speed First Efficiency Second

I came across this quote in the Platforms book: Speed first, efficiency second. It explains that organisations traditionally view common elements as an opportunity to avoid duplication and achieve efficiency by doing things just once instead of multiple times. The overemphasis on efficiency through reuse leads to everything tending to slow down.

I think we have this mindset in building our product and serving multiple channels. Hear me out... we don't want to re-build duplicate things for one channel vs the other - instead we want to be efficient and build it only once.
What we are doing is trading off speed of building to be efficient. e.g. keeping code that is only needed for one sector co-located in the same repos for other sectors makes it way slower to add/remove/enhance.
